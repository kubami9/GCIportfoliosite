            <p class="bigger">There are many things I like to do. As I said in <kbd>About</kbd>, I love making websites, and this is surely my passion. I also like reading books, especially fantasy. When I was younger I even tried to write my own, but it wasn't good idea at all...
            <br><br>
            My next hobby is playing basketball. I train it from about 1,5 year in a small club in my city. Except of trainings (also my own when its not cold outside and I can go and play) I also play with my friends at least once a month. It's a good habit for somebody like me, who could spend hours in front of the screen.
            <br><br>
            I have also a hobby of helping others. It may sound a little bit strange but it's not. Once a year I help in 2 holiday camps organized by foundation: <a href="http://fundacjabarwyzycia.wixsite.com/fundacja" target="_blank">Barwy Å»ycia</a>. On first I learn about developing my talents. On second I practice, it's a children camp and I try my best to give them fun and joy but also this what they need the most, acceptation and help. This is the best time during my year. And naturally I create websites for my friends or help them creating their own.
            <br><br>
            At last but not least I would like to tell about my main hobby. Yeah... Programming. Since I built my first website in HTML and CSS which had only a header and simple text I felt that it's something for me. I watched many tutorial about it and also practiced - becouse this is the most important. Then I started with Bootstrap and I tried a little bit Joomla, but CMS isn't my strong point (or maybe I should start with WordPress).</p>
